## Installation

### With `cargo-binstall`(recommended)

[`cargo-binstall`](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) enables you to install binaries directly without having to build from the source(with `cargo install`) every time.

If you don't have installed yet, you can install it with:

```bash
cargo install cargo-binstall
```

You can then install `cargo-codspeed` with:

```bash
cargo binstall cargo-codspeed
```

### With `cargo`

```bash
cargo install cargo-codspeed --locked
```

## Usage

```
Usage: cargo codspeed <COMMAND>

Commands:
  build  Build the benchmarks
  run    Run the previously built benchmarks

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help information
  -V, --version  Print version information
```

## Advanced Usage

The `vendored-openssl` feature can be used to statically link with openssl with `cargo install cargo-codspeed --features vendored-openssl`.
